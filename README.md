# 🌟 Cymatic Sacred Spaces – Healing Through Frequency & Sacred Geometry

## 📖 Description
A VR-AR immersive healing project that transforms real-world spaces into sacred Cymatic temples using Solfeggio frequencies, spatial acoustics, and neural resonance. Integrated with NeuraSonics AI, biofeedback technology, and sound healing principles, this system creates adaptive environments for meditation, recovery, and spiritual expansion. Designed for hospitals, personal sanctuaries, and consciousness evolution. Open-source for the 99%.

## 🔹 Features
✅ **Cymatic Frequency Architecture** – Procedurally generated sacred spaces based on sound resonance  
✅ **AR Healing Overlays** – Turn any room into a dynamic, frequency-tuned sanctuary  
✅ **VR Sacred Temples** – Fully immersive meditation & healing spaces built on Solfeggio geometry  
✅ **NeuraSonics AI Integration** – Adaptive sound healing responding to biofeedback (EEG, HRV)  
✅ **Miracle Worker AI Priests/Gurus** – Local, encrypted AI guides for meditation & resonance healing  
✅ **Open Source for the 99%** – Built with love, peace, and unity to empower global transformation  

🚀 **Let’s build the future of healing, spirituality, and technology.**
